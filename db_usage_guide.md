# Document Management System Database Usage Guide

## Schema Overview

The PostgreSQL schema for the document management system provides a comprehensive data model for storing and managing documents, their relationships, topics, and summaries. The schema is designed to support a B2B multi-tenant architecture with organizations and users.

## Key Use Cases

### Document Management

The schema supports standard document management operations:

- Storing documents with metadata and content
- Tracking document ownership by users and organizations
- Managing document versions and revision history
- Categorizing documents by type and status

### Relationship Tracking

Documents can be linked through a graph structure:

- Documents become nodes in a graph
- Relationships between documents are explicitly modeled
- Different relationship types can be established (references, contains, etc.)
- Graph traversal queries can discover document networks

### Topic Modeling and Clustering

Documents can be organized semantically:

- Documents can be assigned to topics with relevance scores
- Topics can form hierarchical structures
- Documents can be grouped into clusters based on similarity
- Algorithms and tools that create these assignments are tracked

### Document Summarization

Documents can have multiple summaries:

- Different summary types for different purposes
- Attribution of summaries to the tools/agents that created them
- Confidence scores for quality assessment
- Metadata about the summarization process

## Common Database Operations

### Adding a New Document

1. Insert a record into the `documents` table
2. Create graph nodes for the document
3. Analyze document content to assign topics
4. Generate summaries using various tools
5. Establish relationships with other documents

### Finding Related Documents

1. Query the graph structure to find connected documents
2. Look for documents with similar topics
3. Find documents in the same clusters
4. Use full-text search to find content similarities

### User Access Patterns

1. Query for documents by organization or owner
2. Filter by document type, status, or metadata
3. Search across document content and summaries
4. Retrieve document version history

### Analytics and Reporting

1. Analyze topic distribution across document corpus
2. Evaluate tool/agent performance via confidence scores
3. Track document relationships and networks
4. Monitor document creation and update patterns

## Performance Considerations

- The schema includes indexes for common query patterns
- Full-text search is optimized with GIN indexes
- JSONB fields provide flexible metadata with indexed access
- PostgreSQL features like partial indexes improve query performance

## Maintenance Operations

- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE to maintain index performance
- Monitor index usage to identify optimization opportunities
- Consider partitioning for large document collections
- Implement backup strategies for data protection
