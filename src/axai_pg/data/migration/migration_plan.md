# TypeScript to Python Migration Plan

## 1. Pre-Migration Analysis

### TypeScript Data Access Points
- DataAccessFactory (src/data/DataAccessFactory.ts)
  - Singleton pattern for repository management
  - Metrics tracking per repository
  - Connection pooling via PostgresConnectionManager

### Python Implementation Status
- Enhanced repository factory with thread safety
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Connection pooling and health checks

## 2. Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Verify Python Implementation
   - Confirm all TypeScript patterns are matched in Python
   - Validate thread safety in enhanced factory
   - Test all environment configurations
   - Verify metrics collection matches TypeScript

2. Create Test Suite
   - Port all TypeScript tests to Python
   - Add migration-specific tests
   - Implement comparison tests between implementations

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Database Connection Transition
   - Start with read-only operations in Python
   - Gradually increase connection pool in Python
   - Monitor connection patterns
   - Implement health checks

2. Repository Migration
   - Migrate one repository at a time
   - Order: Document -> User -> Organization
   - Verify each migration with tests
   - Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. Pre-Deployment
   - Full test suite execution
   - Load testing in staging
   - Verify metrics collection
   - Test rollback procedures

2. Deployment Steps
   - Deploy Python implementation
   - Switch read operations to Python
   - Monitor for issues
   - Switch write operations to Python
   - Remove TypeScript implementation

3. Post-Deployment
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Verify data consistency
   - Check error rates
   - Validate connection pooling

## 3. Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions
- Error rate exceeds 1%
- Response time degradation >20%
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Data inconsistencies detected

### Rollback Steps
1. Immediate Actions
   - Switch back to TypeScript implementation
   - Restore original connection pools
   - Verify data consistency
   - Alert development team

2. Recovery Steps
   - Analyze failure cause
   - Update migration plan
   - Fix identified issues
   - Schedule new migration attempt
