# TypeScript to Python Data Access Migration

This module provides tools and scripts for migrating the data access layer from TypeScript/TypeORM to Python/SQLAlchemy.

## Overview

The migration process is designed to be:
- Safe: Comprehensive validation and rollback procedures
- Observable: Detailed monitoring and metrics collection
- Controlled: Step-by-step process with verification
- Reversible: Full rollback capability at any point

## Components

### 1. Migration Tools

- `migrate.py`: Main migration orchestrator
- `migrator.py`: Core migration logic implementation
- `health_monitor.py`: System health monitoring
- `validation_tests.py`: Implementation comparison tests
- `validate_migration.py`: Developer validation utility

### 2. Key Features

- Batch-based migration
- Real-time health monitoring
- Performance comparison
- Data integrity validation
- Comprehensive logging
- Automated rollback

## Usage

### 1. Pre-Migration Validation

Run validation tests to ensure readiness:

```bash
# Run all validation tests
python -m src.data.migration.validate_migration --tests all

# Run specific test categories
python -m src.data.migration.validate_migration --tests operations
python -m src.data.migration.validate_migration --tests performance
python -m src.data.migration.validate_migration --tests errors
```

### 2. Execute Migration

Run the migration process:

```bash
python -m src.data.migration.migrate
```

The migration will:
1. Initialize monitoring
2. Verify implementations
3. Migrate data in batches
4. Validate results
5. Generate reports

### 3. Monitor Progress

Monitor migration progress:

```bash
# View health metrics
tail -f migration_logs/health_metrics.json

# View migration progress
tail -f migration.log
```

### 4. Verify Results

Check migration results:

```bash
# View success/failure report
cat migration_logs/success_report.json  # or failure_report.json

# View validation results
ls -l migration_logs/validation_results_*.json
```

## Configuration

### 1. Environment Settings

Configure in `src/data/config/environments.py`:
- Development settings
- Test settings
- Production settings

### 2. Monitoring Thresholds

Adjust in `health_monitor.py`:
```python
alert_thresholds = {
    "connection_errors": 3,
    "response_time_ms": 1000,
    "cpu_percent": 80,
    "memory_percent": 80,
    "error_rate": 0.01
}
```

### 3. Migration Parameters

Configure in `migrator.py`:
- Batch sizes
- Timeout values
- Retry settings

## Monitoring and Alerts

The health monitoring system tracks:

1. Database Health
   - Connection pool status
   - Query response times
   - Error rates
   - Transaction status

2. System Resources
   - CPU usage
   - Memory utilization
   - Disk usage
   - Network metrics

3. Application Metrics
   - Operation counts
   - Error rates
   - Performance metrics
   - Repository stats

## Rollback Procedure

### 1. Automatic Rollback

Triggers on:
- Error rate exceeds threshold
- Performance degradation
- Data inconsistency
- System health issues

### 2. Manual Rollback

Execute if needed:
```bash
# Cancel current migration
Ctrl+C

# Migration will automatically:
# 1. Stop operations
# 2. Restore TypeScript connections
# 3. Clear partial Python data
# 4. Generate failure report
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues

1. Connection Problems
   ```
   - Check database credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check connection pool settings
   ```

2. Performance Issues
   ```
   - Monitor system resources
   - Check batch sizes
   - Verify index usage
   ```

3. Data Inconsistencies
   ```
   - Check validation results
   - Verify transaction logs
   - Compare record counts
   ```

### 2. Logs and Reports

Find detailed information in:
- `migration.log`: Main migration log
- `migration_logs/`: Detailed reports directory
- `health_metrics.json`: System health data
- `health_issues.json`: Detected issues

## Success Criteria

Migration is considered successful when:

1. Data Integrity
   - All data correctly migrated
   - Relationships preserved
   - Constraints maintained

2. Performance
   - Response times within 20% of TypeScript
   - Resource usage within limits
   - Connection pool optimal

3. Functionality
   - All operations working
   - Error handling verified
   - Security maintained

4. Monitoring
   - Health checks passing
   - Metrics collecting
   - Alerts functioning

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs in `migration_logs/`
2. Review health metrics
3. Contact the development team

## Notes

- Always run validation tests before migration
- Monitor system health during migration
- Keep rollback procedure ready
- Verify all results after migration
