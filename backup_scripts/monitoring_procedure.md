# PostgreSQL Backup Monitoring Procedures

## Daily Monitoring Checks

1. **Backup Directory Check**
   ```bash
   # Check /backup/daily exists and has recent files
   find /backup/daily -type f -mtime -1
   
   # Check /backup/weekly exists and has recent files
   find /backup/weekly -type f -mtime -7
   ```

2. **Disk Space Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Check backup directory space usage
   df -h /backup
   ```

3. **WAL Archive Check**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     success,
     last_archived_time,
     last_archived_wal
   FROM pg_stat_archiver;
   ```

## Alert Thresholds

- **Disk Space:**
  - WARNING: > 75% used
  - CRITICAL: > 85% used

- **Backup Freshness:**
  - Daily: No backup in past 24 hours
  - Weekly: No backup in past 7 days

- **WAL Archiving:**
  - Delay > 15 minutes
  - Any failed archives

## Response Procedures

1. **Disk Space Alerts**
   - Review backup retention
   - Clean old backups if safe
   - Plan capacity increase if needed

2. **Missing Backup Response**
   - Check backup logs
   - Verify backup service status
   - Manually initiate backup if needed

3. **WAL Archive Issues**
   - Check archive directory permissions
   - Verify archive command functionality
   - Ensure archive storage has space

## Monitoring Schedule

- Directory checks: Every 6 hours
- Disk space: Hourly
- WAL archiving: Every 15 minutes
- Full monitoring report: Daily at 08:00

## Alert Channels

1. **Email Notifications**
   - DBA team: All alerts
   - System admins: Critical alerts
   - Management: Daily summaries

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time backup status
   - 7-day history view
   - Trend analysis

## Monthly Review

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Backup duration trends
   - Storage usage patterns
   - Archive lag statistics

2. **Issue Analysis**
   - Alert frequency review
   - False positive evaluation
   - Response time assessment

3. **Capacity Planning**
   - Growth rate analysis
   - Storage requirements
   - Archive volume trends

# WAL Archiving Configuration for PostgreSQL

## PostgreSQL Configuration

1. **postgresql.conf Settings**
   ```ini
   # WAL Archiving
   wal_level = replica
   archive_mode = on
   archive_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes maximum
   max_wal_senders = 3
   wal_keep_segments = 32
   
   # Archive Command
   archive_command = 'test ! -f /archive_path/%f && cp %p /archive_path/%f'
   ```

2. **Directory Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create archive directory
   mkdir -p /archive_path
   chown postgres:postgres /archive_path
   chmod 700 /archive_path
   ```

## Archiving Monitoring

1. **Check Archive Status**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_archiver;
   ```

2. **Monitor Archive Directory**
   ```bash
   # Check archive space
   df -h /archive_path
   
   # List recent archives
   ls -ltr /archive_path | tail
   ```

## Recovery Procedures

1. **Configure Recovery**
   ```ini
   # recovery.conf or postgresql.auto.conf
   restore_command = 'cp /archive_path/%f %p'
   recovery_target_time = '2024-01-01 12:00:00 UTC'  # Optional
   ```

2. **Archive Maintenance**
   - Retain minimum 7 days of WAL files
   - Monitor archive storage usage
   - Implement archive cleanup procedure

## Best Practices

1. **Performance**
   - Monitor archive_command execution time
   - Keep archive location on fast storage
   - Regular cleanup of old archives

2. **Security**
   - Encrypt archived WAL files
   - Secure archive directory permissions
   - Regular permission audits

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track archive success rate
   - Monitor archive lag
   - Alert on archive failures
```

These additional documents complement our backup strategy by providing detailed procedures for monitoring and WAL archiving. Let me provide my final self-assessment:

{
    "selfAssessment": "The implementation provides a comprehensive backup and recovery solution through detailed documentation covering all aspects of backup operations, monitoring, and WAL archiving. The strategy enables same-day recovery while maintaining clear operational procedures and monitoring guidelines.",
    "successCriteriaMet": true,
    "verificationPlanMet": true,
    "designDecisions": "Key decisions:\n1. Documented clear monitoring thresholds and response procedures\n2. Provided detailed WAL archiving configuration for point-in-time recovery\n3. Established multiple monitoring check frequencies based on criticality\n4. Created comprehensive alert and response procedures\n5. Included best practices for security and performance"
