# PostgreSQL Schema Verification Guide

## Verification Steps

To verify that the PostgreSQL schema for the document management system has been correctly implemented and meets the requirements, follow these verification steps:

### 1. Schema Implementation Verification

- Create a PostgreSQL database and execute the schema.sql script to create all tables, constraints, and indexes
- Verify that all tables are created without errors
- Confirm that all constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints) are properly defined
- Validate that all indexes have been created correctly

### 2. Data Integrity Testing

- Insert sample data that tests all constraints
- Verify cascading deletes work as expected
- Test uniqueness constraints
- Validate check constraints by attempting to insert invalid data
- Confirm that triggers for updated_at fields function correctly

### 3. Query Performance Testing

- Execute the following query types and verify they complete within the target response time (<1 second):
  - Retrieving documents by owner/organization
  - Full-text search within document content
  - Traversing relationships between documents
  - Finding documents by topic or cluster
  - Querying for summaries by tool/agent

- Test with progressively larger datasets to understand scaling characteristics
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify and address performance bottlenecks

### 4. Schema Completeness Testing

- Verify that all required functionality can be implemented using the schema:
  - Document storage with versioning
  - Organization and user ownership
  - Graph relationships between documents
  - Topic and cluster organization
  - Summary generation with tool attribution

## Success Criteria

The schema implementation meets the following criteria:

1. All required tables, constraints, and indexes are created successfully
2. Data integrity is maintained through proper constraints and relationships
3. Query performance meets the target of <1 second response time for typical operations
4. The schema supports all the required functionality for the document management system
5. The schema correctly models the B2B multi-tenant structure with organization and user ownership

## Load Testing Scenarios

For thorough testing, consider the following load scenarios:

1. **Basic Usage**: Dozens of concurrent users, hundreds of documents
2. **Moderate Load**: 50-100 concurrent users, thousands of documents
3. **Heavy Usage**: 100+ concurrent users, tens of thousands of documents

Monitor the following during load testing:
- Query response times
- Connection pool utilization
- Index performance and potential bloat
- Database resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O)

## Optimization Opportunities

If performance issues are identified, consider:

1. Adding additional indexes for specific query patterns
2. Implementing materialized views for complex, frequently-used queries
3. Adding table partitioning for very large document collections
4. Implementing connection pooling optimizations
5. Using PostgreSQL pg_stat tables to identify unused or inefficient indexes
